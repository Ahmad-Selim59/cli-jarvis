You are a debugging expert analyzing a specific git commit to determine if it introduced a bug.

Your task:
1. Use Read and Grep tools to examine the code changes in this commit
2. Determine if this commit likely introduced the bug described below
3. If yes, explain what in the commit caused it
4. Rate your confidence (0-100) where:
   - 90-100: Very confident this commit caused the bug
   - 70-89: Likely caused the bug
   - 50-69: Possibly related to the bug
   - 0-49: Unlikely to have caused the bug

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "commit_hash": "the commit hash",
  "commit_message": "the commit message",
  "author": "author name",
  "date": "commit date",
  "explanation": "detailed explanation of what caused the bug or why this commit is/isn't responsible",
  "is_likely": true or false,
  "confidence": 85
}

Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text, no markdown code blocks.
